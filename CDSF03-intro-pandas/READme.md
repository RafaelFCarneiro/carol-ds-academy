# Introduction to Pandas [1]

In this class we will present the main funcionalities for `pandas`. We named the files with the prefix `XX-` then it is easy to follow the sequence of notebooks. 


## Library Highlights [2]

1. A fast and efficient DataFrame object for data manipulation with integrated indexing;
1. Tools for reading and writing data between in-memory data structures and different formats: CSV and text files, Microsoft Excel, SQL databases, and the fast HDF5 format;
1. Intelligent data alignment and integrated handling of missing data: gain automatic label-based alignment in computations and easily manipulate messy data into an orderly form;
1. Flexible reshaping and pivoting of data sets;
1. Intelligent label-based slicing, fancy indexing, and subsetting of large data sets;
1. Columns can be inserted and deleted from data structures for size mutability;
1. Aggregating or transforming data with a powerful group by engine allowing split-apply-combine operations on data sets;
1. High performance merging and joining of data sets;
1. Hierarchical axis indexing provides an intuitive way of working with high-dimensional data in a lower-dimensional data structure;
1. Time series-functionality: date range generation and frequency conversion, moving window statistics, moving window linear regressions, date shifting and lagging. Even create domain-specific time offsets and join time series without losing data;
1. Highly optimized for performance, with critical code paths written in Cython or C.

In the folder `resources` one can find a `python`, a `pandas` and a `matplotlib` cheat sheet.
